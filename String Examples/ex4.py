#This exercise we can start using variables
cars = 100
print ("There are", cars, "cars in the factory")

price = 34999.99
print ("Each car costs", price)

#Using underscores to make variable names is really dumb so I'm gonna stick to camelcasing
costPerCar = price
income = costPerCar * cars
print ("If we sell all", cars, "cars, at a cost of", costPerCar, "per car, we will make$", income)
