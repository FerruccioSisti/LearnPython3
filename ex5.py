#Introduced string and printing with formats
#formatting is really neat because I don't have to seperate the string 400000 times
name = "Ferruccio Sisti"
age = 20
hairColour = "brown"
residence = "Canada"

#It doesn't add spacing around the variable brackets which is really nice
print(f"My name is {name}. I am {age} and have {hairColour} hair. I live in {residence}.")
